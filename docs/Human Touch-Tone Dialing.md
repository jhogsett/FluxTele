## Human Touch-Tone Dialing

Example: dialing 1-800-555-0199

- dial "1"
- slight pause to remember the area code, confirm it's right, and prepare to dial it
- dial "8" then dial "00", with the "00" slightly faster since it's the same numeral
- slight pause to remember the prefix, confirm it's right, and prepare to dial it
- dial "555" confidently since it's the same numeral
- slight pause to remember to suffix, confirm it's right, and prepare to dial it
- dial "0" then "1"
- very slight pause to remember to the second half of the suffix, confirm it's right, and prepare to dial it
- dial "99" confidently since it's the same numeral

## Touch-Tone Press Length

- Currently the DTMF tones are unnaturally short. Humans hold the button pressed for longer, and without mechanical precision so it's the time needs to be somewhat random.
- Delays between digits should also not all be precisely the same amount of time but be somewhat random.
